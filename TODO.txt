Set in mansion with lots of rooms
Go room to room to avoid killer
Arrive in the hall, killer is in random room. Survive until morning, escape or kill killer?

Like Cluedo? Multiple guests?

More you carry more noise you make / killer hears you move
defend yourself
Distract
Hide in places
Turn lights on and off (off = can't see. on = killer can see)
MOVE
INTERACT
HIDE
